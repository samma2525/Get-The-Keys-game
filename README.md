# Get The Keys game
You need to get the keys to pass to the other side!


This game is about a weird character who needs to pass to the other side, but needs to get the keys so the door can open. There are two different types of enemies, vertical patrolling enemy (Crabs) and horizontal patrolling enemy (Spiders), they cause -25 damage with every hit; the player has 100 health in total. The controls are WASD.
There are ten levels made till now, but I might update this game in the future to get more types of enemies and challenges with different environments. I have spent 7.5 hours making this game on Unity engine.
